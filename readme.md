## rEFInd Next theme

[rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) is a simplistic boot manager for UEFI
based systems. This is a clean and minimal theme for it.

I Just re-upload from
![rEFInd Next](http://sdbinwiiexe.deviantart.com/)

### Usage

To use this theme you'll want to clone it into the same directory as your rEFInd
efi executable (usually `/boot/EFI/refind/`). Then you will want to add the following line to the end of your `refind.conf`:
	include next-theme/theme.conf


To set the appropriate background image, edit the “theme.conf” file in TextEdit and change the banner line to direct to whichever image file corresponds to your mac’s native resolution.
E.g. If your native resolution is 1440x900, you’d change the line to the following:
	banner next-theme/background_900.png

To make an icon appear when loading using graphical boot, open boot_bg.png file in your image editor of choice, and just copy the operating system’s os_ icon over top of the background.  Then save the new image using the boot_ prefix.  A few examples have been included (windows, linux, ubuntu, linux mint, unknown)

To set the icons for your entries you will want to add the `icon` configuration
to each menuentry which points to the icon under `next-theme/icons` that you
would like to use for that entry.

Here's an example configuration:

````
menuentry "Arch Linux" {
	icon /EFI/refind/next-theme/icons/os_arch.png
	loader vmlinuz-linux
	initrd initramfs-linux.img
	options "ro root=UUID=dfb2919d-ff78-48db-a8a7-23f7542c343a loglevel=3"
}

menuentry "Windows" {
	icon /EFI/refind/next-theme/icons/os_win.png
	loader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi
}

menuentry "OSX" {
	icon /EFI/refind/next-theme/icons/os_mac.png
	loader /EFI/Apple/Boot/bootmgfw.efi
}
````

Entries that are autodetected should also show the proper icons.

# Description
This description from devian art pages

As I plan on setting up a triple boot on my computer once the new versions of Windows, OS X, and Linux become released, I decided an update to my rEFIt/rEFInd boot screen was in order. This theme is inspired by both iOS 7 and Windows 8 interfaces.

rEFIt's development has been halted for a while now; a maintained for of it called rEFInd is available as a suggested replacement.

I created the theme using current themes/guides as a base, but have not thoroughly tested it. If there are any issues, please let me know and I'll see what I can do. Instructions for how to set up the theme are in the package, as well as instructions for how to set up OS-specific icon profiles (useful for linux distros).

The theme contains icons for the following operating systems:
 - macOS (OS X)
 - Windows 7 and older
 - Windows 8 and newer
 - Chrome OS
 - FreeBSD
 - Arch Linux
 - Android
 - Antergos
 - CentOS
 - Debian
 - Deepin
 - Elementary OS
 - Fedora
 - Kali Linux
 - Linux Mint
 - Mageia
 - Manjaro
 - Mandriva
 - NetBoot/iPXE
 - OpenSUSE
 - PC Linux OS
 - Puppy Linux
 - Red Hat
 - Sabayon
 - Slackware
 - Solus
 - Steam OS
 - Ubuntu Flavours
     - Ubuntu
     - Xubuntu
     - Lubuntu
     - Kubuntu
     - Edubuntu
     - Ubuntu Studio
     - Ubuntu Mate
     - Ubuntu Budgie
 - Zorin
 - General Linux Distributions (Generic Tux)
 - Legacy Operating Systems (Generic Icon)
 - General Other/Unknown
